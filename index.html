                <h2>More Than Fitness</h2>
                <p>Fitness can be achieved in a lot of ways. There is no one way of staying fit,
                    and for some people, eating healthy does the trick.
                    <br>
                    For some people, vigorous exercise is the only way out.
                    <br>
                    People have different needs, and ways to stay fit varies according to their needs.
                    We need to understand that or weight is not the only factor here. Fat people are not always unhealthy.
                    <br>
                    People can be overweight and still be perfectly fit.
                    The best way to stay fit is to take out some time from our busy schedules and exercise.
                    Dancing and cycling are great ways to keep fit, running, brisk walking, jogging, and skipping are also important.
                    <br>
                    Staying fit ensures a healthier and functional life.
